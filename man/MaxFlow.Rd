\usage{
MaxFlow(
  arcSources,
  arcTargets,
  arcCapacities,
  sourceNode,
  destNode,
  numNodes,
  algorithm = "Preflow"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{arcSources}{Vector corresponding to the source nodes of a graph's
edges}

\item{arcTargets}{Vector corresponding to the destination nodes of a graph's
edges}

\item{arcCapacities}{Vector corresponding to the capacities of nodes of a
graph's edges}

\item{sourceNode}{The source node}

\item{destNode}{The destination node}

\item{numNodes}{The number of nodes in the graph}

\item{algorithm}{Choices of algorithm include "Preflow" and "EdmondsKarp".
"Preflow" is the default.}
}
\value{
A list containing three entries: 1) A vector corresponding to the
  flows of arcs in the graph, 2) A vector of cut-values of the graph's nodes,
  and 3) the total cost of the flows in the graph, i.e. the maxflow value.
}
\description{
Finds the maximum flow of a directed graph, given a source and destination
node.
